# Central Limit Theorem & Nonparametric Statistics Demos

## Background

The Central Limit Theorem is a remarkable theorem in probabilty, but developing an intuitive understanding of it can be tricky. Here are a few demos to help the inquisitive explore the properties, assumptions, and limitations of this theorem.

Additionally, there are two demos to explore the advantages and disadvantages of nonparametric statistics using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test.

## Setup

Running these demos requires python and a jupyter notebook. The easiest way to do this is to install the latest version of `anaconda`.

1. Go [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to download the latest version of anaconda for you OS. BE SURE TO DOWNLOAD PYTHON 3.X
2. Follow the instructions to install anaconda.
3. Clone this repository to your computer.

## Running

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the clone of this repository. Be sure to be in `/path/to/Useful-minis/Central_Limit_Theorem`
3. Run `$ jupyter notebook`. This will automatically open a jupyter notebook server in your web browser
4. In the jupyter brower page, open `demo_CLT.ipynb`
5. In the menu bar, select `Cell > Run All`.
